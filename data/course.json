  "course_description": "*Learn Differential Equations: Up Close with* *\\_Gilbert Strang* and\\_ *Cleve Moler* is an in-depth series of videos about differential equations and the MATLAB\u00ae ODE suite. These videos are suitable for students and life-long learners to enjoy.\n\nAbout the Instructors\n\nGilbert Strang is the MathWorks Professor of Mathematics at MIT. His research focuses on mathematical analysis, linear algebra and PDEs. He has written textbooks on linear algebra, computational science, finite elements, wavelets, GPS, and calculus.\n\nCleve Moler is chief mathematician, chairman, and cofounder of MathWorks. He was a professor of math and computer science for almost 20 years at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the University of New Mexico.\n\nThese videos were produced by {{% resource_link \"95a7d085-df3a-43f4-884d-3cb79cb330c1\" \"The MathWorks{{\\< sup \\\"\u00ae\\\" >}}\" %}} and are also available on {{% resource_link \"1eeb36f5-0478-4598-9883-fbc1d8457dac\" \"The MathWorks website\" %}}.",
